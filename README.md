## Publication
This is the official implementation of the paper titled "Causal Explainability of Machine Learning in Heart Failure Prediction from Electronic Health Records".

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study is curated from the All of Us Research Program. Because of their policy, we can't share the data here directly. On this page, we use the gallstone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as an example.

## Experiments
### Computational framework
'computational_framework.ipynb' is the workflow of our proposed computational framework.

### Machine learning model and Evaluation framework
'ML.ipynb' is the workflow of our proposed evaluation framework.
